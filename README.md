## Ideas:

### ml5, posenet, p5js

- with video on
- don't overwrite the background
- different color skeleton & keypoints
- different markers for the keypoints
- smiley face for the head

### Other stuff

- not sure which angle is best... i think its best when the person is facing the camera
- it's prob best to just film a couple of minutes, it gets boring after too long
- what else to explore with the posenet lib?
