## Ideas:
### ml5, posenet, p5js
* with video on
* don't overwrite the background
* different color skeleton & keypoints
* different markers for the keypoints
* smiley face for the head

### Other stuff
* not sure which angle is best... i think its best when the person is facing the camera
* it's prob best to just film a couple of minutes, it gets boring after too long
* what else to explore with the posenet lib?
